When uploading your changes to github please make another branch and make a Pull Request when you are ready

When coding on the branch make sure you are doing these following commands every session:

[getting started with github](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/)

`git checkout main & pull`    : this checks the version of main and syncs the version from github to yours

`git checkout <your branch>`  : this switches to your branch

`git pull origin main`        : this pulls down the changes in main to your current branch preventing merge conflicts later down the line
